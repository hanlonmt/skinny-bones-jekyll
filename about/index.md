##### I wanted this page to be called "the m<sup>th</sup> degree", but that was already taken by a marketing firm. I went with "the m<sup>th</sup> root", which is pretty radical.  
Roots happen to be one of my favorite things, and my initials are MTH, so this site came to life. Most of my posts will relate to science (mostly plants!), education, and academia, but there will be a good bit of other stuff hidden in here as well. Though my living is science, my life is much more than science.

## Who am I?

I am a graduate student in the [Plant Biology program at Penn State University](http://www.huck.psu.edu/content/graduate-programs/plant-biology). Specifically, I study root growth and behavior and variation and all sorts of things about roots ([more here](http://plantscience.psu.edu/directory/mth14)). When I'm not sciencing, I like to swim, go for bike rides, play soccer, and bake cookies. I actually like doing many more things than that, but we'll start there. More things that I like can be found on the "Other Goodies" page, where I'll keep a list of things that I dig, both on the internet and off. You can get in touch with me via [email](themthroot@gmail.com) or drop me a line on twitter ([@molslarity](http://twitter.com/molslarity)).
