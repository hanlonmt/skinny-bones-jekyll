>I want to share my knowledge and discoveries with the world. I worked hard to come to these conclusions, and I think they represent novel ideas that will change the course of though and allow for forward progression of both science and soceity as a whole.

That is what scientists think, in a noble sense, before publishing. What we generally really think is "I can't *wait* to get this paper out so that people acknowledge my greatness and give me money to pursue further work." We are human.
<br><br>
But, let's assume for a minute that I take the first, upstanding approach toward sharing my work. First, I have to get my work in a format that a single journal likes. Time consuming, but not too bad. Then I have to submit it through some online platform, during which my computer will sieze up and refuse to move forward, my university internet connection will fail one or ten times, and I will have trouble finding the files, unsure if I want to submit "manuscript_FINAL_1a" or "manuscript_FINAL_1aplus." In the end, it goes through, and for a measly monetary sum, I might be lucky enough to get my work published. By measly, I mean likely somewhere around $1000. Then, via an editor, reviewers get their hands on my work, proceed to tear it to shreds behind the veil of anonimity, require that I do unrelated or unhelpful experiments lest my prized results will sit forever in purgatory. After months of work, they finally give it the nod, the publishing company gladly takes my money, and my paper turns up online somewhere for people (who either have insitutional access or are willing to pay some ungoldly sum for access to a 6-page pdf file) can read it. Do you see problems with this? Join the club, because everyone, and I mean *everyone* has some sort of problem with this.
<br><br>
That leaves us with one question:
<br> 
#How do we use publication for it's main objective: *to share carefully conducted, reviewed, and accepted scientific findings to the greater public*?
<br><br>
There has to be a soltuion, we just have to find it. Some ideas include:
<br>
**1. Make everything free** 
<br>
I'm no business(wo)man, but I do understand that this isn't really feasible in the greater sense, but a lot of our problems stem from cost. If we eliminate to cost to access (the Open Access movement), then the cost to authors tends to rise. Though this isn't a problem for some labs, smaller and lesser-funded labs may have difficulty scrounging together the cost of publication. Making everying free would eliminate this, but then no one would make any money and the publishing platform would have no way to sustain itself. I understand this argument in theory, but I'm a grad student and make little money, so I don't have much sympathy.

**2. Eliminate Anonimty**
