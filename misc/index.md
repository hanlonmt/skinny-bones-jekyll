This is a work in progress, but I've decided to make it live rather than sit on it. Having an unfinished page out there may actually motivate me to finish it.

This is a collection of things I like and want you to know about. I'm likely forgetting things and will be updating this as I discover new things! This should be somewhat organized and navigable by the pane at the left. I am an Android and Windows (holler, ThinkPad) user, so anything that is Apple-specific probably won't show up here.

## Apps
I use many stock apps (Gmail, Maps, Calendar) and other standard apps (I'm looking at you, Facebook), but I'll use this space to highlight things that don't just come with your phone.

######Listening
- **[Stitcher](http://www.stitcher.com/)**: My day-to-day podcast app. The "Listen Later" feature is great for making an on-the-go playlist and collecting news stories to listen to while I work or cook. I'm not *completely* in love with Stitcher, but it works for the most part and the tech support team has been helpful when I've had issues.
- [DoggCatcher](http://www.doggcatcher.com/): I left DoggCatcher for Stitcher, but still go to it from time-to-time because Stitcher doesn't have everything. 
- [NPROne](http://www.npr.org/about/products/npr-one/): My mind runs on NPR.
- [Google Music All Acccess](https://play.google.com/about/music/allaccess/#/): I used Spotify and Pandora, but found the Spotify app to be buggy and was sick of hearing about the Free Business Cards I had won on Pandora. I switched to Google's platform and haven't looked back, as it has a huge library and has helped me discover some new music. I still go back to Pandora sometimes, but that is happening less and less.
- [Sonos](http://www.sonos.com/?r=1): Not so much an app as it is a product (you need the speaker for the app to work), but it's the only way I listen to music, news, or podcasts when I'm at home.
- [OverDrive](http://www.overdrive.com/): Coupled with my local library resources, I use this to listen to audiobooks when there's something I really want to *read* and don't have time to get my hands on the book. I've read quite a few books this way while working in the lab.
