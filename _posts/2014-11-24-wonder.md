1. When will the sun come up? 
2. Is the sun up but it's just too cloudy to see the sun?
3. Why don't I remember more from college?

That mostly sums up what's on my mind today. It's not so cold, but quite dark in Norrland today, which is as to be expected in late November. The short days wouldn't be so bad if they actually felt like days, but this has been the [darkest November on record](http://www.thelocal.se/20141116/sweden-heads-for-darkest-november-on-record).
<br><br>
The third question on my list may be the most crucial to actually getting anything done. Sometimes I wonder if I left my brain somewhere at my undergraduate institution or if I just forgot all of the material that I was supposed to remember. The whole reason I've subjected myself to these months of darkness is to carry out some analytical work on the hormonal and metabolomic signature of specific roots, which requires a lot of chemistry that I haven't thought about in years. In my younger years, I did actually study Biochemistry and some of these things I hear sound familiar, but it's been a while, and I seem to have forgotten.
<br><br>
It's not just analytical chemistry that I've forgotten, though, it's ... everything. This often makes me wonder: is everything we learn, not just as undergraduates, but at every stage of education, as disposable as it seems on a daily basis? It's like when you're playing trivia at the bar and you're asked questions about state capitols, presidents, or geography, things that you *certainly* knew at age 11, but promptly forgot after you got the sticker on your test. Where did that knowledge go, and why did we learn it in the first place?
<br><br>
Immediately after college, a friend of mine and I worked as technicians in two very different labs at two very different universities. We lamented over the same things: annoying graduate students, disorganized bench space, and incomprehensible protocols. The worst, though, were the new people in the lab: they didn't seem to be able to do anything. Through all of this complaining, we came to a conclusion. It wasn't that we were overconfident in our lab abilities or that these people who we were frustrated with didn't have abilities, it was that we were willing to and able to learn new concepts and apply them. We may have not had all of the factual knowledge (neither of us had worked with the systems we were employed to handle), but we could read, deduce, and move forward. Put simply, we knew how to learn.
<br><br>
Some may call it critical thinking or problem solving, but to me, these things are really just learning. Many of the undergraduates who I teach (more on them at a later date) can memorize facts and draw out pathways that I never attempted to commit to memory, but when presented with a problem that requires higher-order thinking, they crumble. Is it that our education system rewards the wrong things or is it that we just value the wrong things? 
<br><br>
In 2008, an article in Forbes by Daniel Born captured this sentiment as he described teaching his introductory English course. This comes through in the end:  

> He wasn't going to be an academic superstar, but he was on his way to making better, more articulate arguments and learning how to summon evidence, on his way to moving with less fear and more freedom through the world of the text. He had learned that he could speak up and make a contribution to the dialog. He was going to survive college. He was learning how to learn.

I'll forever value my liberal arts education, where facts weren't the golden ticket to success, but rather creative and critical thinking were awarded through carefully articulated arguments. I do think I've lost some of my writing and speaking skills that aren't honed as continuously at the bench, but I know that they're still there, just a bit rusty.
<br><br>
So as I sit here struggling through some chemistry, I realize that it doesn't matter that I need to refer to a textbook (or Wikipedia. Mostly Wikipedia) because I know that I can. I also know that I can take these concepts and expand upon them to get what I need. In the meantime, though, I mostly feel like this:
