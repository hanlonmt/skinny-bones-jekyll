After years of thinking about it, I finally gave in, made myself a website, and spent a day figuring out how to work this thing. My goal is to post two to three times per week with some sort of substantial writing with each of these. As I live in the world of science, most of my posts will probably be about science, but I'll touch on life as a graduate student, education, swimming, or whatever else I feel like discussing.

##### Why now?

I'm currently living in Ume√•, Sweden doing research at the Swedish Agricultural University. It is also November. It gets dark around 3 PM, providing me little incentive to go outside. I also have talked to my friends about these things exhaustively, and I think they'd rather not hear me talk non-stop. If there's something you'd like to see me discuss, shoot me an email. If you'd like to write a guest post, do the same!

##### And a dog video

Because I love dogs and have nothing else to say right now.
